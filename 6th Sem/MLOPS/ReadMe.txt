app.py -> provides the web interface for the streamlit (frontend)

Machine_Predictive_Maintenance_Classification.ipynb:
is the model in the python notebook which can run on vscode, jupyter notebook, google Collab (preferably)

model.pkl:
it is the condesend model that used by the app.py to run the streamlit application. (encrypted model)

predictive_maintence.csv:
is the given dataset for the model.

ReadMe.txt:
instructions file.

Steps to run the program:
1. open the Notebook in your google collab  
2. add the following files to your collab notebook as-well (attach the app.py, dataset(predictive_maintence.csv)).
3. Run all the cells of the notebook
4. the model.pkl will be generated by the notebook while running the model/program. 
5. Copy the IP generated.
6. Open the last URL in the streamlit application hosting cell.
7. Enter the IP copied by the previous cell.
8. The streamlit application should run successfully now.
9. Test out the model with the dataset or give your own values from the internet and evaluate the model.
